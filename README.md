# React Social Media

Hi all!

This is my first version of my project "Social Network on React". 

For the most part, I've been delving into learning React itself, so the social network is still very raw. Some pages aren't ready yet, and the site is for computers only. But now that all the basics of React are learned, I can continue to improve my social network.

Plans are already in the works: 

- Switch from js to ts.
- Make the site responsive for all devices
- Finish the unfinished pages

And much more!

You can try the first version of the site at this link:
